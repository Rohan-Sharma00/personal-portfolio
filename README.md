# Rohan Sharma – Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built to showcase my work as an **AI-Driven Full Stack Engineer**.  
The goal of this project is to present my experience, projects, and technical skills in a clean, performant, and production-ready manner.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I built this portfolio to:

- Present my **professional experience and company projects** clearly
- Showcase **real-world engineering work**, not just demos
- Highlight my focus on **performance, architecture, and scalability**
- Create a single place for recruiters to explore my work, resume, and contact details
- Practice building a **high-quality frontend system** using modern tooling

This is not a template or static site — it’s treated as a real product with attention to structure, performance, and UX.
